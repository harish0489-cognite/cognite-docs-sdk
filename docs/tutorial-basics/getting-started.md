# Getting Started

Follow our development quickstart to get up and running with Cognite Data Fusion in a few simple steps. And don't worry if you don't have your own project and data yet. You can use an API key and data from the Open Industrial Data project (opens new window)- a live industrial data stream - to start learning.


<!-- # Cognite SDK Introduction -->

<!-- Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**. -->

### Installation

<!-- Get started by **creating a new site**. -->
<!-- 
Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Generate a new site -->

<!-- Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**: -->

```shell
npm install @cognite/sdk --save
```

or

```shell
yarn add @cognite/sdk
```

<!-- 
Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
``` -->
<!-- 
Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
